# Data Dictionary Cleaning

This folder contains Python notebooks used to read in the data dictionary provided by WTSC and output a JSON-formatted version of the dictionary that can be used by future developers to automate analysis of WTSC data. The `.JSON` file in this directory is the reformatted and cleaned dictionary produced by the notebooks.
